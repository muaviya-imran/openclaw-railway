# Web Utilities

This skill provides advanced capabilities for interacting with the web.

## Actions

### Web Search (SearXNG)
Search the web using a private SearXNG instance. Returns JSON results.
```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/search.sh "query string"
```

### Summarize Strategy
Summarize the content of a URL (text or video) using AI.
```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/summarize.sh "https://example.com/article"
```

### Advanced Scrape
Fetch web content. Supports basic `curl`, `browser` (Headless Chromium), or `botasaurus` logic.
```bash
# Basic (fast)
{baseDir}/scripts/scrape.sh --mode curl "https://example.com"

# Advanced (JavaScript support)
{baseDir}/scripts/scrape.sh --mode browser "https://example.com"
```
